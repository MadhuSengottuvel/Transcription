Developed an AI-powered audio-to-text transcription tool utilizing the AssemblyAI API.
The idea was to assist those with physical disability and hearing impairments.
The software focuses on keeping the interface simple and user-friendly, allowing users to upload or record audio and receive a transcription immediately.
I selected AssemblyAI due to its great accuracy and compatibility for many accents.
